# -Early-Predicting-of-Students-Performance-in-Higher-Education-using-Machine-Language
This project applies machine learning techniques to predict student performance at an early stage, enabling timely interventions and improving educational outcomes. It explores both clustering and classification models using synthetic data generated via Python.

## 📌 Objectives
- Predict student GPA using admission scores, course grades, AAT, and GAT.
- Apply dimensionality reduction (t-SNE) to visualize feature relationships.
- Evaluate multiple ML models including Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost.
- Provide insights for early academic intervention.

## 🧠 Techniques Used
- **Data Generation**: Synthetic dataset simulating real-world student attributes.
- **Preprocessing**: OneHotEncoding, StandardScaler, missing value handling.
- **Visualization**: Seaborn, Matplotlib for EDA and performance metrics.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: t-SNE for clustering and feature mapping.
- **Classification Models**: Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, XGBoost.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score.

## 📊 Dataset Overview
- 24 attributes including student ID, gender, campus, course, GPA, AAT, GAT, and admission criteria.
- Train/Test split: 80/20.
